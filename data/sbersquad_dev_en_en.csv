10	Interest rate and exchange rate	"<s>paragraph: For adequate monetary policy, the Bank of Canada uses a monetary policy index that combines interest rates and exchange rates. A 3-point exchange rate change is equivalent to a 1-point change in interest rates. In response to economic development, it makes decisions based on these indices. For example, when the Bank has to directly influence monetary policy, the exchange rate may be affected by a change in the daily target financing rate. Thus, an increase in the interest rate often means an increase in capital investment to Canada from abroad as well as a significant dollar position. The Bank of Canada is also trying to maintain monetary conditions consistent with long-term monetary policy objectives. From the time when monetary policy is determined to have a real impact on the economy, there is a slight delay of 18 to 24 months. This delay is due to a long process of consistent interaction, and it is necessary to limit monetary conditions and influence inflation.

The Polocese, perhaps in the name of peace on trade routes, is more tolerant of the Baltic-speaking neighbours. In the land, crooked periods of peaceful coexistence, without external runs, contribute to diffusion, mutual absorption. Inducing into the pan-European civilizational process, mediated by its trade links through the Baltics, is parallel to the emergence of the Russian State itself.

553	Certify the information provided	urge company managers to report on the effectiveness of internal controls	"<s>paragraph: In 2001, COSO initiated a project to develop a risk management framework for the use of company management in assessing and further improving risk management. The project involved PricewaterhouseCoopers. A number of corporate scandals and failures that were widely publicized (e.g. Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and World Com) required strengthening of corporate governance and improved risk management. As a result, Sarbeins-Oxley Act was enacted. This law expands the long-standing requirement for open equity societies to establish and maintain internal control systems by requiring company management to report on the effectiveness of these systems and an independent auditor to certify the information provided. The internal control framework continues to be the accepted standard for meeting these reporting requirements, but in 2004 COSO publishes the organization's Risk Management Framework.

In the flood of the rivers and on the islands, piercing shrubs and 3–7 m high trees (tugais) are common, and there are areas of meadow vegetation, with areas growing up to 4 m high. The desert vegetation is burned up by the bushes (Tamarisk, Jusgun) up to 2 m high, by the semi-rubbers (boilers, biyragun, mudslides) up to 0.5 m high and by the herbs (heads, jaantac) in the desert. Travous cover in the desert is only in the spring, by the beginning of June the grass burns out. On the territory of the cosmodrome there is a Borshov tulip, which blooms in April; this plant has become one of the symbols of the cosmos and is mentioned in many articles, books and films on the lower desert, the grass is only in the spring, by the beginning of June the grass.

588	Low pressure vapours entering the working cell	oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 	"<s>paragraph: Early steam cars were first called fire engines, as well as the vacuum or condensing engines of Watt. They were operated on a vacuum basis and are therefore also known as vacuum engines. Such machines were used to drive piston pumps, at least there is no evidence that they were used for other purposes. When a vacuum-type steam machine is operated at the start of a low pressure pair, they enter the working chamber or cylinder. The intake valve is then closed and the vapour cools by condensing. In the Newcom engine, cooling water is sprayed directly into the cylinder, and the condensate escapes into the condensate. This creates a vacuum in the cylinder. The atmospheric pressure at the top of the cylinder is pressured on the piston and causes it to move downward, that is, the working motion.

On the basis of this, such critics argue, these taxa should not be used in the system at all. Thus, the biological system, in their understanding, should completely depart from Linnei taxonomic taxonomy and become a simple hierarchy of treasure. The weight of the argument depends critically on how often, during evolution, the gradiental equilibrium of environmental conditions is disrupted. The quasi-stabilised state of ecosystems leads to slow phylogenesis, which can be difficult to interpret within the Linnea system; at the same time, a catastrophic event brings the taxa out of ecological equilibrium and usually results in the separation of treasure features. This separation takes place during evolutionaryly short time and results in a taxon system that is easily described within the Linnea classification.

The scale of their activities is illustrated by the published data: it was necessary to cut and burn 30 square kilometres of shrubs and small trees, to cut and burn grass in the same area, to drain a million square yards (80 ha) of marshes, to dig 250,000 feet (76 km) of water pumping water and to restore 2 million feet (600 km) of their activity, old moats and small trees, to cut and burn grass in the same area, to dry a million square yards (80 ha) of marshes, to dig 250,000 feet (760,000 km) of water and to restore 2 million feet (600 km) of old rugs, which were not enough to be able to be more than 150s and more than to be more than 150 million gallons of them.

Maziers stated that the Stellar System was unlikely to be safe when working with more than one verification node, stating that when consensus was not reached, there was a fork of the registry with parts of the network that disagreed with the transactions. Stellar Foundation later claimed that there were inherent deficiencies in the consensus process itself, an assertion that according to Finnance Magnates, Ripple categorically denied.

Some biologists, anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists believe that this discrimination on the basis of identity has arisen because it increases the group &apos; s chances of survival. This view has been confirmed in some simple computer models of evolution. In these models, such discrimination sometimes results in unexpected close cooperation with the group &apos; s representatives, but also difficult to explain hospitality towards the representatives of another group. G. R. Johnson (Gary R. Johnson) and V. S. Falger (V.S. Falger) argue that nationalism and patriotism are forms of this distinction between their own and those who do not.

For the first time, a polymerase model of ultraviolet mutagenesis was proposed by Bresler. He suggested that mutations are caused by the fact that DNA-polymerases in front of photodimers are sometimes introduced by non-complex nucleotides. This view is now generally accepted. A rule is known, according to which in front of damaged areas of DNA-polymerase is most likely to inject adenines. The polymerase model explains the nature of mushroom mutations of base replacement.

"<s>paragraph: The rise in the number of mutual credit societies led to the need to unite mutual credit societies in the form of the Central Bank of Mutual Credit Societies (CBOs). One of the reasons for the merger of JMCs was the fact that, at the same time, some JMCs were lending in commercial banks and others holding free funds in them. Thus, commercial banks were intermediaries in the allocation of funds between JMCs, receiving substantial interest for this, leaving the money in the management of the JMC itself was the main purpose of the association. In 1909, the JMC was opened up. It was created on the same organizational principles as other JABs: each of the buyers was able to obtain a 10-fold increase in his contribution to capital. The JMC activities were constrained by the fact that, according to the statute, he could not attract funds from the population. Therefore, despite the large loans at the State Bank and the commercial banks held by the JAB, the problem was the lack of funds.

1360	statistical shadows of past and current market signals	 sample of future data	"<s>paragraph: To make rigorous statistical projections for the future, we need to get a sample of future data. Since this is not possible, many experts suggest that samples from past and current indicators, such as market indicators, are equivalent to a sample from the future. In other words, if this is the case, it becomes clear that the projections are only statistical shadows of past and current market signals. Such an approach consolidates the work of an analyst in determining how market participants receive and process market signals. Without the sustainability of series, it is not possible to draw reasonable conclusions. This does not mean that a series should be sustainable in everything. For example, it may have stable dispersions and completely non-permanent averages, in which case we will only draw conclusions about variance, in the opposite case only about the average. Sustainability may be more exotic. The search for stability in the series is one of the statistical tasks.

This year, Benedetto Castelli, in his letter, suggested that Galileo, who had a great interest in star observation at that time, should look at the Mizar; his undescribed description of Galileo's observation as a double star was retained. Next to Mizar, the eye sees a star of 4 magnitudes of Alcor (80 Great Bear), which in Arabic means forgotten, or insignificant.

"<s>paragraph: Mizar was the second of the double stars discovered in the telescope by Italian astronomer Giovanni Richcholi in 1650. However, according to studies by Czech astronomer Leos Ondra, Mizar was probably seen as double in 1617 by Galileo. This year, Benedetto Castelli, in his letter, suggested that Galileo, who had a great interest in star observation at that time, should look at the Mizar; his undescribed description of Galileo's observation as a double star was retained. Next to Mizar, the eye sees a star of 4 magnitudes of Alcor (80 Great Bear), which in Arabic means forgotten, or insignificant. It is believed that the ability to distinguish the star Alcor from ancient times was a recognized test of vision.

1633	Single expansion direct vehicles	vertical single expansion	"<s>paragraph: Direct steam machines have emerged from an attempt to overcome one disadvantage inherent in steam machines with traditional vapour distribution. The fact is that steam in a normal steam machine constantly changes the direction of its motion, because for both entry and release, the same window is used on each side of the cylinder. When the steam leaves the cylinder, it cools its walls and steam distribution channels. The fresh steam, therefore, spends a certain part of its energy on heating, which results in a fall in efficiency. Direct steam machines have an additional window that opens with a piston at the end of each phase and through which the steam leaves the cylinder. This improves the efficiency of the machine because the steam is moving in the same direction, and the temperature gradient of the cylinder walls remains more or less constant. Direct single expansion machines show about the same efficiency as composite machines with normal vapour distribution. In addition, they can operate at a higher speed, and therefore, until steam turbines become available, they have often been applied to power generators requiring high rotation.

1773	Slowly	 Finally, by xi-century	"<s>paragraph: Philosophy in the regions where Christianity was practised developed slowly because it was subordinated to a particular doctrine. The initial period of Christian philosophy (up to the fourth century) is characterized by attempts to rationally justify Christianity, to give it additional weight. This period of philosophy is called patriotic, and its most prominent figure is the Blessed Augustine, who has integrated neopltonism and Christianity, removing anything that is contrary to the Bible from neoplatonism. The later period of Christian philosophy is called a holocaust, which is characterized by the formation of philosophical schools in church organizations that have performed various missions. The most famous philosopher of this period is Thomas Aquinski, who, in carrying out this commission, united Christianity with aristotelism.

1843	in the most primitive form	owing to the absence of sexual cells	"<s>paragraph: In other bacteria, apart from reproduction, there is a sexual process, but in the most primitive form. The sexual process of bacteria is different from the sexual process of eukariot by the fact that bacteria do not produce hamates and do not merge cells. However, the main event of the sex process, namely the exchange of genetic material, also occurs in this case. This is called genetic recombination. Part of the DNA (very rarely all DNA) of the donor cell is transferred to a cell-recipient whose DNA is genetically different from that of the donor. The DNA is replacing part of the DNA of the recipient. In the process of replacing the DNA, enzymes that divide and reconnect DNA chains are involved. The DNA that contains genes of both parent cells is formed. This DNA is called recombinant. In progeny, or recombinants, there is a marked diversity of features caused by gene displacement. This diversity of features is very important for evolution and is the main advantage of the sex process.

1932	the possibility of understanding the pattern of the literary process	 Formalization capacity	"<s>paragraph: In its philosophical roots in idealism, in its approach to literary work as a phenomenon of pure, self-satisfied form, formalism has deprived itself of the ability to understand the pattern of the literary process and has limited the study of the poetic structure to essentially external, empirical observations, which are often arbitrary and random in their conclusions; however, formalistic research is flawed by fragmentation and unilateralism: without understanding the essence of literature as a phenomenon of ideology, a formalist cannot provide a holistic and comprehensive concept of the structure of the poetic work, reducing it to a formal dominant.

In most cases, amitosis is observed in cells with reduced mitotic activity: it is an aging or pathologically modified cell, often doomed to death (cages of the embryos of mammals, tumor cells, etc.). In the case of amitosis, morphologically, the morphological state of the kernel remains interphasy, it is clearly visible to the core and the nuclear shell. DNA replication is missing. There is no replication of chromosomes. Chromosomes are not detected. The cell retains its inherent functional activity, which is almost completely disappearing in the mitose. For example, the division of macronucleuses of many informations, where, without the formation of turbos, short chromosomal fragments are segregated.

1984	progress in molecular biology	owing to the success of molecular biology	"<s>paragraph: Macromolecular data, which refer to the sequence of genetic material and proteins, accumulate at an ever-increasing rate due to the success of molecular biology. For evolutionary biology, the rapid accumulation of data from the sequences of whole genomes is of considerable value because the nature of DNA itself allows it to be used as a document of evolutionary history. Comparisons of the DNA sequences of different genes in different organisms can tell the scientist much new about the evolutionary relationships of organisms that can not be otherwise detected on the basis of morphology, or the external form of organisms, and their internal structure. Since genomes evolve through the gradual accumulation of mutations, the number of different nucleotid sequences between different genomes of different organisms should indicate how long these two genomes have separated the common ancestor. The two genomes that have been separated in the recent past should have fewer differences than the two genomes, whose common ancest is very long ago. Therefore, comparing different genomes with each other, it is possible to obtain information about the evolutionary relationship between them.

1996	Careful choice and identification of characteristics	 Definition of characteristics and the increase in the number of them	"<s>paragraph: The use of homoplasia in morphological data sets can often be avoided by a precise definition of the characteristics and an increase in the number of them: in the previous example, using the wings with feathers, the wings with whale exoskeleton and the skin wings as characteristic, the evolutionaryly false association of the three listed groups of animals on the basis of homoplasis can be avoided. In the analysis of superdervives (the databases that include more taxons of the sediment studied), the use of inaccurate signs may become inevitable because otherwise the signs may not be applicable to all multiple taxons. Say, a sign such as the presence of wings cannot be used to analyse the flogization of real multi-cell animals (Eumetasoa), since most of these types of tacos are not present. Thus, the precautionary choice and characterization of the characteristics is another important element of cladistic analysis.

2102	Nokia	 Nokia	"<s>paragraph: In the early 2000s, the boundary between smartphones and communicators was more pronounced. The first communicators were in fact PPCs with an additional GSM model. They were not different in size from the PPC (the 3.5-4 inch screen, the 320x240 resolution, or weight resolution, and additional telephone functions contributed to the cost of the machine and reduced the time of autonomous operation. The smartphones, in turn, differed little from the telephones, the size of the screen and its resolution were low, and the functionality did not reach CPC. Nokia, while promoting its smartphones, focused on design, play and multimedia capabilities, etc., without focusing on the intellectuality of the devices. However, over time, the products called smartphones and communicators were closer; the size of the commicators was reduced; the size of the commicators was reduced; and the telephone functions became a priority; on the contrary, the size of the smartphones was increased and the functionality reached the level of PPC.

2104	Spontaneous DNA damage	 Unintentional DNA Damage	"<s>paragraph: Spontaneous DNA damage occurs quite frequently, and such events occur in each cell. In order to remedy the consequences of such damage, there are special reparatory mechanisms (e.g., an erroneous area of DNA is cut and the source is restored). Mutations occur only when the reparation mechanism for some reason fails or fails to repair the damage. Mutations in genes encoded proteins responsible for reparation can lead to multiple increases (mutatorial effects) or decreases (antimutative effects) in the frequency of mutation of other genes. Thus, mutations of the genes of many enzyon enzymes of the excion system lead to a sharp increase in the frequency of somatic mutations in human beings, which in turn leads to the development of pigmental xeroderma and malignant tumours of the cover.

Like most of the world &apos; s major rivers with a large basin area, Lena is characterized by periodic changes in annual runoff followed by 11 years of solar activity. The first type of peak occurs about the year after the start of the new solar cycle and can be explained by the intense melting of venoms and merva produced over the past 2-3 years, as well as by the development of Arctic oscillation and increased rainfall within the basin during the winter.[20] In this case, there is the most marked increase in runoff, e.g. in 1989, the average annual discharge of water was 23,054 m3/s, corresponding to 728 km3/year. The second type is less grown and occurs in the middle of the 11-year cycle, is characterized by a small spring flood and is achieved by increased rainfall during the summer- fall period.

2258	Geometry of the signs	oscillographics	"<s>paragraph: Another direction in the development of generic phonology has been the autosegment phonology (J. Goldsmith) and its underlying theory of syllable (J. Clements and S. Keiser) and character geometry (J. Clements). In this theory, syllables and its parts, segments, as well as tones and differential features are treated as separate distinct elements of the phonological system. Recognitions form a hierarchical structure subordinate to the segment but they can change independently. For example, the process of assimilation is interpreted as an operation to separate the sign from the root of the segment and its association with the neighbouring segment. There are different directions in the geometry theory of the signs, which differ in the range of differential features describing the location of the segment. The sign may correspond either to the main active articator (drums, end of the language, back of the language, etc.) or to the passive artifactor (alveol, nabo, etc.).

The reasons for this sharp decline are unclear. It is assumed that the dynamo operation 4 billion years ago was due to the presence of an asteroid that rotated between 50 and 75,000 kilometres around Mars and caused instability in its core. The asteroid then fell to the limit of Rocha and collapsed. However, this explanation itself contains uncertainties and is disputed in the scientific community.

In 1985, monetary reform was carried out and 1 Inti was exchanged for 1,000 soles. In 1986, the banknote of the highest number was 1,000 Inti. However, in September 1988, the monthly rate of inflation reached 132 per cent. In August 1990, the monthly rate of inflation was 397%. The highest nominal inti: 10,000,000 was introduced in 1991. In 1991, monetary reform was carried out, and 1 new salt was exchanged for 1,000,000 Inti. The effects of hyper-inflation: 1 Nuevo Sol = 1,000,000 000 000 000 (old) salts. Inflation slowed down in 1991, but it was stopped only with the introduction of a new currency unit of Peruvian salt in 2001.

It is inextricably linked to the intensification of agriculture and is a major economic result. The increase in the mass and standards of differential rent II is created by an increase in the productivity of additional capital investments, which, contrary to the so-called law of declining soil fertility (see the laws of declining soil fertility), becomes the main and determining factor in the context of scientific and technological progress. The additional capital investment of excess profits before the end of the lease contract is made available to the landlord. However, in the case of a new lease agreement, the landowner, by virtue of the domination of the monopoly of private land ownership, assigns to himself this additional profit by increasing the rent, i.e. a portion of the Differential Rent II.

2626	IgM	igm	"<s>paragraph: When a system of acquired immunity in vertebrates encounters a virus, it forms specific antibodies that join the virus and often make it non-hazardous. This is called a humour immunity. Two types of antibodies are the most important. The first, called IgM, has a high efficiency in neutralizing the virus, but is formed by immune system cells only for a few weeks. The synth of the second, IgG, continues indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the host's blood indicates a severe infection, at which time IgG indicates an infection that has been transported in the past. It is the amount of IgG measured in immunity tests. The antibodies can continue to be an effective protective mechanism even when the virus can enter the cell. The TRIM21 cell protein can attach the antibodies to the surface of the virus particles. This causes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell protosome system.

2732	from the length of the receptacles, the number of parallel receptacles included and the radius of the receptacles	ribbon length, number of parallel receptacles and radius of receptacles	"<s>paragraph: Thus, the overall peripheral resistance depends on the length of the receptacles, the number of parallel receptacles included and the radius of the receptacles. It is clear that there is no practical way to understand all these values, and that the walls of the receptacles are not rigid and blood does not act as a classic Newton fluid with permanent viscosity. By virtue of this, as noted by V. A. Lyshuk in the Mathematical circulatory theory, the Poiseil Law has an illustrative rather than a constructive role for circulation. However, it is clear that, of all the factors determining peripheral resistance, the most important is the radius of the receptacles (the length of the formula is 1st, the radius is 4th), and that the same factor is the only one capable of physiological regulation. The number and length of the receptacles is constant, but the radius may vary according to the tone of the receptacles, mainly arteriol.

"<s>paragraph: The existence of absolute advantages where a country can produce a particular product at a lower cost, i.e. using fewer resources than its potential foreign trading partners, is at the heart of the international division of labour: it is in the production of such goods that they should be specialized in selling their surplus through international trade in exchange for products that are not produced in the country; as a result of this exchange of goods between States, each of them benefits, or receives, in its own order, those goods that it is not in a position to produce, or by acquiring foreign products at prices far below those that domestic producers can provide; in other words, international trade becomes an activity that benefits all participants.

While the electronics industry was moving towards creating increasingly complex microprocessors with increasingly large complex command systems to ensure that as many complex operations as possible could be performed by one team, the RICS designers drew attention to the fact that, for most machine time, the processor performed commands that were a very small subset of the entire command system. The same 20/80 rule was formulated to apply to the operation of the processor: during 80 per cent of the operating time, the processor performed 20 per cent of the total number of teams implemented. A natural idea emerged: to remove 80 per cent of the rarely used commands from the processor scheme, leaving only 20 per cent of the frequently used commands, and to simplify the scheme to make it more productive.

2830	19th century	 the 19th century	"<s>paragraph: The theory of endogenous money dates back to the 19th century, described by Joseph Schumpeter, and later by followers of post-oceanism.The theory of endogenous money argues that support for money is a credit-driven and endogenousity is driven by the need for bank loans rather than the foreign policy of monetary authorities. Although this is not a conviction of the dominant economic theory, a number of central bankers and monetary economists believe that a bank multiplier or recredit model is not a realistic way to describe how banks work in reality and how deposits lead to credit, reverse causality leads to deposits.

The colours of the molluscs can be changed to milliseconds. Generally, the brighter color palithro contains coastal species. And those that prefer the open ocean are limited in camouflage. In addition to merging with the surrounding background, some molluscs have the potential for bioluminescence. They can glow from the bottom to mask their shadows from predators that may be hidden below. This property can also be used to lure prey (some mollusks display colours), attract the opposite sex, and even communicate with each other. The nature of the bioluminescence of these animals is not yet clear. Presumably light is produced by special symbiotic bacteria.

2899	Creitive	 Creationist	"<s>paragraph: Creitive's direction was marked by the entry into jazz of elements of experimentalism and avant-garde. The beginning of this process coincided in part with the emergence of free jazz. The elements of jazz avant-garde, understood as the changes and innovations introduced into music, have always been experimental. So the new forms of experimentalism proposed by jazz in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were the most radical departure from tradition, introducing new elements of rhythms, tonalism and structures. In fact, avant-garde music became synonymous with open forms, which were more difficult to describe than even free jazz.

Cyclin is a regulatory protein and is found in all eukaryos; its concentration increases periodically during the cell cycle, peaking at the metaphase of mitosis. With the onset of the anafase, there has been a sharp decrease in the concentration of the cyclic cyclic with complex protein proteolytic complexes. The cycline-dependent protein is an enzyme (phosphoralase) that modifys proteins at the expense of the transport of the phosphate group from the ATF to the amino acids of serin and treonin. Thus, with the establishment of the role and structure of the main mitotic division regulator, studies have begun on the thin control mechanisms of mytose that continue to date.

It seems that if we say something like: Portrait, a painting that performed the function of photography when the photograph has not yet been invented, then we will exhaust the basic questions that arise when we begin to reflect on this painting genre. The words of ‘ mysteriousity and ‘ incomprehensible functions of portraits in culture seem to be thought of. However, without fear of opposition of this kind, we dare to argue that the portrait clearly confirms the common truth: the more understandable the picture does not have the past and the future, it is always in the present time. The time of the portrait — dynamic, its ‘ real, always full memory of the past and the prediction of the future... Portrait constantly fluctuates on the edge of artistic doubling and the mystical reflection of reality.

This hypothesis is described as the RNA-mir hypothesis. According to it, RNA, during the first stages of evolution, autocatalysed the synthesis of other RNA molecules and then DNA. In the second stage of evolution, synthetic DNA molecules, as more stable, became a repository of genetic information. The protein synthesus on the RNA matrix, using the full RNA, expanded the prebiotic systems, gradually replaced the RNA in structural aspects.

"<s>paragraph: A large group of mammals are semi-aquatic forms — species that live in part on land, partly in water; some of these animals (norca, white bear, water flooring, guttering) swim well and dive, but maintain a common terrestrial form; their relationship to the aquatic environment is reflected in the fact that they produce their food not only on land but also in water; the ecological niche of semi-water forms of mammals has begun to develop in the middle of mesozoa: the specialization to a semi-aquatic way of life is characteristic of, inter alia, the docodonate of the castorocauda from the middle yura.

The block of such material is sufficiently strong, stable and chemically inert to prevent the release of radioactive substances into the environment with water and air. The blocks are placed in storage, for example deep wells in the thick of persistent and impermeable mountain rocks, where they can lay hundreds of years to the natural loss of radioactivity. The same method is proposed for the conservation of certain toxic substances.

The fashion cycle is re-induction, promotion, popular culmination, and loss of style, and it works through different social groups. Marketologists who ride fashion cycles change or mix styles to different segments of the market. This is very common in the garment industry. A certain style of clothing will initially target a very expensive segment of the market, but it will gradually adjust to make this style of clothing available at a lower cost. The fashion cycle can repeat itself when a stylistically obsolete product can return popularity and thus stop being obsolete.

This technique was developed shortly before and used in a valtorna game; the performer inserted his hand into a piece of instrument to achieve a different sound. In order to enable the player to perform such an action, a natural semi-Oval-shaped tube was designed, with the appearance of a semi-month (for example, in France, it was named Fr. thrompette demi-lune). The main effect was also the crown of the fa, it was also possible for her to transfer the sound to mi-bemol or re. Rusrub was therefore directed sideways during the game. Although such design did allow closed sounds to be generated, the oval bend had a negative effect on the coloring of the instrument, and the resulting effects were almost similar to the closed sound of the valtorna, except that the latter were stronger.
